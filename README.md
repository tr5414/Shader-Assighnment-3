# Shader-Assighnment-3
This is, by a very large margin, the silliest thing I've ever submitted for homework. 
In accorance with the project instructions, I have recreated a particle system that mimics some naturalistic phenomenon, albiet one inspired by the 2009 animated movie, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. 
The rate and frequency at which the particles are determined by the in scene music, which is the main themee to Cloudy with a Chance of Meetballs. Additional audio has been taken from The Office.
I apologize in advance for any brain cells lost.
